### My Capstone Project [@neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/)

Bazam is a regional marketplace for baby and children's clothing.

The app offers young and expectant parents the opportunity to sell and buy second hand clothing regionally.

The personal contact to other parents has an important value as well as the ecological thought, cause you sell and by only in your “neighborhood”.

Bazam was built with Next.js and optimized for mobile use with 375x667px (e.g. iPhone SE 2nd gen or iPhone 6/7/8).
